Starting the device: When the power button is pressed an electrical current is sent from the battery or power supply to the devices circuitry. The processor chip then 
resets itself and finds the firmware which contains the start up instructions. A series of tests is run to check all the components of the device and to check that all 
peripheral devices are properly plugged in. If the tests are successful then the device will load the kernal which is the core of any operating system. The operating system
then loads configuration information, verifies the user and loads the user interface.
