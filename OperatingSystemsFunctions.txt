Starting the device: When the power button is pressed an electrical current is sent from the battery or power supply to the devices circuitry. The processor chip then 
resets itself and finds the firmware which contains the start up instructions. A series of tests is run to check all the components of the device and to check that all 
peripheral devices are properly plugged in. If the tests are successful then the device will load the kernal which is the core of any operating system. The operating system
then loads configuration information, verifies the user and loads the user interface.

Graphical User Interface(GUI): Allows you to interact with the device using menus and visual images. This is usually done via touching, pointing, tapping or clicking. The 
GUI is loaded as soon as the device is finished with the start up function. Most modern devices come with a customizable GUI.

Manages Programs: Single tasking operating systems allow only one program to be running at a time while multitasking opertating systems allow multiple programms to be run
at the same time. When multitasking, the program that is currently being used is in the foreground while the other programs are in the background. Some operating systems
allow multiple users to run programs at the same time. Manages the download and insallation of new programs as well as updates for existing ones.
